# Background
This was a small SQL practice project aimed at exploring data analyst job data â€” identifying the most in-demand and highest-paying skills.


### The questions I wanted to answer through my SQL queries were:
1. What are the top-paying data analyst jobs?
2. What skills are required for these top-paying jobs?
3. What skills are most in demand for data analysts?
4. Which skills are associated with higher salaries?
5. What are the most optimal skills to learn?

---

## Tools I Used
- **SQL**: To query and analyze the data.
- **PostgreSQL**: The database system used.
- **VS Code**: For writing and running SQL scripts.
- **Git & GitHub**: For version control and project sharing.

## The Analysis
Each SQL query focuses on a different aspect of the data analyst job market:
1. **Top Paying Jobs** â€“ Identifies roles offering the highest salaries.

```sql
SELECT
    job_id,
    job_title,
    job_location,
    job_schedule_type,
    salary_year_avg,
    job_posted_date,
    name AS company_name
FROM
    job_postings_fact
LEFT JOIN company_dim ON job_postings_fact.company_id = company_dim.company_id
WHERE
    job_title_short = 'Data Analyst' AND
    job_location = 'Anywhere' AND  -- possible to desired location --
    salary_year_avg IS NOT NULL
ORDER BY
    salary_year_avg DESC
LIMIT 10
```


2. **Top Paying Job Skills** â€“ Finds which skills are required for those top-paying positions.

```sql

WITH top_paying_jobs AS (
    SELECT
        job_id,
        job_title,
        salary_year_avg,
        name AS company_name
    FROM
        job_postings_fact
    LEFT JOIN company_dim ON job_postings_fact.company_id = company_dim.company_id
    WHERE
        job_title_short = 'Data Analyst' AND
        job_location = 'Anywhere' AND
        salary_year_avg IS NOT NULL
    ORDER BY
        salary_year_avg DESC
    LIMIT 10
)
SELECT
    top_paying_jobs.*,
    skills
FROM top_paying_jobs
INNER JOIN skills_job_dim ON top_paying_jobs.job_id = skills_job_dim.job_id
INNER JOIN skills_dim ON skills_job_dim.skill_id = skills_dim.skill_id
ORDER BY
    salary_year_avg DESC;
```

3. **Most In-Demand Skills** â€“ Lists the skills most frequently requested by employers.

```sql
SELECT
    skills,
    COUNT(skills_job_dim.job_id) AS demand_count
FROM job_postings_fact
INNER JOIN skills_job_dim ON job_postings_fact.job_id = skills_job_dim.job_id
INNER JOIN skills_dim ON skills_job_dim.skill_id = skills_dim.skill_id
WHERE
    job_title_short = 'Data Analyst' AND
    job_work_from_home = TRUE
GROUP BY
    skills 
ORDER BY
    demand_count DESC
LIMIT 5;

```

4. **Top Paying Skills** â€“ Reveals which skills command the highest salaries.

```sql
SELECT
    skills,
    ROUND(AVG(salary_year_avg), 2) AS avg_salary
FROM job_postings_fact
INNER JOIN skills_job_dim ON job_postings_fact.job_id = skills_job_dim.job_id
INNER JOIN skills_dim ON skills_job_dim.skill_id = skills_dim.skill_id
WHERE
    job_title_short = 'Data Analyst'
    AND salary_year_avg IS NOT NULL
    -- AND job_work_from_home = True
GROUP BY
    skills
ORDER BY
    avg_salary DESC
LIMIT 25;

```

5. **Most Optimal Skills** â€“ Combines demand and pay data to highlight the best skills to learn for both financial reward and employability.

```sql

WITH skills_demand AS (
    SELECT
        skills_dim.skill_id,
        skills_dim.skills,
        COUNT(skills_job_dim.job_id) AS demand_count
    FROM job_postings_fact
    INNER JOIN skills_job_dim ON job_postings_fact.job_id = skills_job_dim.job_id
    INNER JOIN skills_dim ON skills_job_dim.skill_id = skills_dim.skill_id
    WHERE
        job_title_short = 'Data Analyst'
        AND salary_year_avg IS NOT NULL
        AND job_work_from_home = True
    GROUP BY
        skills_dim.skill_id
), average_salary AS (
    SELECT
        skills_job_dim.skill_id,
        ROUND(AVG(job_postings_fact.salary_year_avg), 0) AS avg_salary
    FROM job_postings_fact
    INNER JOIN skills_job_dim ON job_postings_fact.job_id = skills_job_dim.job_id
    INNER JOIN skills_dim ON skills_job_dim.skill_id = skills_dim.skill_id
    WHERE
        job_title_short = 'Data Analyst'
        AND salary_year_avg IS NOT NULL
        AND job_work_from_home = True
    GROUP BY
        skills_job_dim.skill_id
)
SELECT
    skills_demand.skill_id,
    skills_demand.skills,
    demand_count,
    avg_salary
FROM
    skills_demand
INNER JOIN average_salary ON skills_demand.skill_id = average_salary.skill_id
ORDER BY
    demand_count DESC,
    avg_salary DESC
LIMIT 25

-- rewriting this same query more concisely
SELECT
    skills_dim.skill_id,
    skills_dim.skills,
    COUNT(skills_job_dim.job_id) AS demand_count,
    ROUND(AVG(job_postings_fact.salary_year_avg), 0) AS avg_salary
FROM job_postings_fact
INNER JOIN skills_job_dim ON job_postings_fact.job_id = skills_job_dim.job_id
INNER JOIN skills_dim ON skills_job_dim.skill_id = skills_dim.skill_id
WHERE
    job_title_short = 'Data Analyst'
    AND salary_year_avg IS NOT NULL
    AND job_work_from_home = True
GROUP BY
    skills_dim.skill_id
HAVING
    COUNT(skills_job_dim.job_id) > 10
ORDER BY
    avg_salary DESC,
    demand_count DESC
LIMIT 25;

```
